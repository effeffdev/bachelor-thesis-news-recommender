This code was used to generate results for my bachelor thesis titled "Comparing General Purpose Sequence-Aware Recommender Systems in the News Domain".

## Abstract

Recommender systems are nowadays used in many applications to help users navigate the ever growing mass of content.
Traditional recommender systems use long-term user information to predict fitting next items, but in some applications such information is not available.
Sequence-aware recommender systems do not need this long-term information, but use the current user session to make predictions.
Such systems are implemented in many different application domains. 
In this thesis we take a look at the news domain and its specific challenges.
We compare the performance of three general purpose sequence-aware recommender systems on real-world data from the news domain.
Our results show that on datasets with very unbalanced content distributions these general purpose recommender systems are not able to reliably outperform the simple Popularity method, but might be useful alternatives under specific conditions.
